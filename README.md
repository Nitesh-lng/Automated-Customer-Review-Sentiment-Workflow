# Automated Customer Review Sentiment Workflow
🤖 AI-powered customer service automation that analyzes review sentiment and generates personalized responses using LangChain & LangGraph

## Problem Statement

Modern businesses must process and respond to a flood of customer reviews. Manual triage is time-consuming and can lead to delayed or generic support. This project **automates review handling**:  
- **Classifies review sentiment** (positive, negative—easily extensible to neutral and beyond)  
- **Extracts issue category, customer tone, and urgency for negative reviews**  
- **Composes nuanced, context-aware replies** that acknowledge and address the customer’s experience

**Key Components:**
- **Sentiment Analysis:** LLM classifies review sentiment.
- **Conditional Routing:** Directs workflow based on sentiment outcome.
- **Diagnosis:** For negatives, LLM extracts structured issue type, tone, and urgency.
- **Contextual Response:** LLM crafts a human-like, brand-aligned reply.

## Features

- **Automated sentiment classification**
- **Detailed complaint triage:** Extracts actionable info from negative reviews
- **Personalized responses:** Empathetic, situationally aware messaging
- **Type-safe, extensible workflow using LangGraph**
- **Integration-ready for large-scale support systems**

## Customization

### Adding New Issue Types

To support additional complaint categories, edit your `run_diag` prompt:
```python
"1. Issue Type (e.g., 'service', 'product', 'delivery', 'billing', 'technical', 'account'):\n"
```

### Adjusting Response Templates

Tweak the prompt in the `response` function to align replies with your company’s voice, policy, or regulatory needs.

### Extending Sentiment Categories

Expand `LLMCondition`:
```python
sentiment: Literal['Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral'] = Field(description="Find the sentiment...")
```
Update your conditional logic and graph routing as needed.

## Performance Considerations

- **Model:** LLaMA-3.3-70b-versatile = state-of-the-art accuracy
- **Speed:** Groq’s LLM inference is optimized for ultra-fast (<1s typical) responses
- **Scalability:** Efficient, parallelizable architecture—can process thousands of reviews per hour
- **Token Efficiency:** Structured outputs minimize response length and cost

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-language support** for global scalability
- **Integration with customer service platforms** (Zendesk, Freshdesk, Salesforce)
- **Automated escalation**: human handoff for complex or priority cases
- **Analytics dashboard** for review insight & management
- **A/B testing** of reply templates for optimal customer satisfaction
- **Plugin for review platforms** (Amazon, Google, Trustpilot, etc.)
